There are some odd editor errors being thrown in the console for some reason with this fresh install of LTS (2020.3.19).
Doesnt affect the actual code.

Also could not build with  LTS (2020.3.19). There is a known error with android SDK on this version.

So I copied the project into a new 2019.4.0 LTS version (down grade did not work smoothly with package dependencies ) for the build requirement.
